#1 - Numbers of Letters of Numbers (Python) - 6 kata

If we write out the digits of "60" as English words we get "sixzero"; the number of letters in "sixzero" is seven. The number of letters in "seven" is five. The number of letters in "five" is four. The number of letters in "four" is four: we have reached a stable equilibrium.

Note: for integers larger than 9, write out the names of each digit in a single word (instead of the proper name of the number in English). For example, write 12 as "onetwo" (instead of twelve), and 999 as "nineninenine" (instead of nine hundred and ninety-nine).

For any integer between 0 and 999, return an array showing the path from that integer to a stable equilibrium:

Examples
numbersOfLetters(60) --> ["sixzero", "seven", "five", "four"]
numbersOfLetters(1) --> ["one", "three", "five", "four"]

#2 - Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list. (Python) - 8 kata
Note: Empty arrays should return 0.


#3 We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

#4 What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.
