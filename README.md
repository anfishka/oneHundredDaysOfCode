#1 - Numbers of Letters of Numbers (Python) - 6 kata

If we write out the digits of "60" as English words we get "sixzero"; the number of letters in "sixzero" is seven. The number of letters in "seven" is five. The number of letters in "five" is four. The number of letters in "four" is four: we have reached a stable equilibrium.

Note: for integers larger than 9, write out the names of each digit in a single word (instead of the proper name of the number in English). For example, write 12 as "onetwo" (instead of twelve), and 999 as "nineninenine" (instead of nine hundred and ninety-nine).

For any integer between 0 and 999, return an array showing the path from that integer to a stable equilibrium:

Examples
numbersOfLetters(60) --> ["sixzero", "seven", "five", "four"]
numbersOfLetters(1) --> ["one", "three", "five", "four"]

#2 - Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list. (Python) - 8 kata
Note: Empty arrays should return 0.


#3 We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

#4 What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

#5 Make a function that returns the value multiplied by 50 and increased by 6. If the value entered is a string it should return "Error".

#6 Complete the function which converts a binary number (given as a string) to a decimal number.

#7 There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

#8 When provided with a letter, return its position in the alphabet.

Input :: "a"

Ouput :: "Position of alphabet: 1"

#9 Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date and time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".

#10 Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.

Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

Python - 8 kata

#11 Triple Trouble
Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!

E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"

Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.
